# Simple Terminal Calculator in Python

A basic command-line calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Download `calculator.py`.
3. Run the program from the terminal using the command: `python calculator.py`
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to select an operation and input numbers.

## What I Learned / Concepts Demonstrated
* Defining and calling functions for each mathematical operation (`add`, `subtract`, `divide`, `multiply`).
* Receiving and converting user input (`input()` and `int()`).
* Using `if/elif/else` statements to select and perform the correct operation.
* Implementing a main loop (`while True`) to allow the user to perform multiple calculations.
* A function (`want_continue`) to ask the user if they wish to continue.
